All previous results for \THC~are in the \emph{fully synchronous} model, where a protocol proceeds in rounds. This model makes
two assumptions: first, the parties have access to synchronized clocks, and 
second, every message is guaranteed to be delivered within one round.
While the first assumption is reasonable in practice, as nowadays computers 
usually stay synchronized with milliseconds of variation, the second assumption 
makes protocols inherently impractical.
In practice, the first assumption appears reasonable, since nowadays computers 
usually stay synchronized with milliseconds of variation. On the 
other hand, the second assumption makes protocols inherently impractical. 
This is because the running time of 
a protocol is always counted in the number of rounds, and the round length must be chosen based on the most pessimistic bound 
on the message delivery time.
For concreteness, consider a network where most of the time messages are delivered within milliseconds, but one of 
the connections, once in a while, may slow down to a couple of hours. In this 
case, a round would have to take a couple of hours.
