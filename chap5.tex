\chapter{Fine-Grained Cryptography}\label{chap:FGC}
In this chapter, we identify sufficient properties for a fine-grained average-case assumption that imply cryptographic primitives such as fine-grained public key cryptography (PKC).
We build a novel cryptographic key exchange using
a problem with a small number of relatively weak structural properties, such that if a computational problem satisfies them, our key exchange has provable fine-grained security guarantees, based on the hardness of the problem. We then show that a natural and plausible average-case assumption for the key problem Zero-$k$-Clique from fine-grained complexity satisfies our properties. We also develop fine-grained one-way functions and hardcore bits even under these weaker assumptions.


Where previous works had to assume random oracles or the existence of strong one-way functions to get a key-exchange computable in $O(n)$ time secure against $O(n^2)$ adversaries (see [Merkle'78] and [BGI'08]), our assumptions seem much weaker. Our key exchange has a similar gap, $O(n)$ secure against $O(n^{1.5-\epsilon})$ adversaries, between the computation of the honest party and the adversary as prior work, while being non-interactive, implying fine-grained PKC.
We also show that using more specific properties of Zero-$k$-Clique, we can build a key exchange computable in $O(n)$ time secure against $O(n^{2 - \epsilon})$ adversaries, approaching Merkle's construction guarantees.

This chapter is based on \cite{LLVW19}.
