I would first like to thank my advisors Vinod Vaikuntanathan and Virginia Vassilesvka Williams. Thanks to Vinod for supporting me during my entire time at MIT, giving me the freedom to research what I was interested in and guidance along the way. Regardless of which topic I was looking into or thought I had a result for, he always made sure I understood all aspects of the proofs and background material. He taught me how to properly analyze and write up my results.
Special thanks to Virginia for mentoring me, and encouraging me to pursue new kinds of cryptography. Even though I studied a completely different subfield, we were able to find a lot of common ground. I learned so much during our meetings and developed a much bigger appreciation for complexity theory and algorithms.

Next, a huge thanks to Tal Moran first for introducing me to Topology-Hiding Computation, and then being a supportive coauthor. Tal helped me
