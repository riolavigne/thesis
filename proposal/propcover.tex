\def\abstract{
One of the core goals of cryptography is to be able to offer security and privacy without sacrificing functionality. This thesis describes three different functionalities and notions of security and privacy and how they interplay. First, we delve into Topology-Hiding Computation, which has a very restrictive definition of privacy making it difficult to construct; nevertheless we provide a two constructions. Second, we invent a new cryptographic concept called Property Preserving Hashes, where we want to compress inputs while securely preserving a certain property between them, e.g. hamming distance. Finally, we explore Fine-Grained Cryptography, and develop a public key cryptosystem. In this notion of cryptography, security takes on a much less restrictive role (e.g. adversaries must run in $O(n^{100})$ time), but the protocols and security reductions must run in ``fine-grained'' time, e.g. less than $O(n^2)$.
