	The last few years have seen a resurgence in interest in fine-grained cryptography, which had its origins in fine-grained key exchanges in the 70s (see [Merkle'78] and [BGI'08]). In 2016 Degweakr, Vaikuntanathan, and Vasudevan [DVV'16] explored a circuit-complexity-based approach, bounding computation power of adversaries by NC$^0$ or AC$^0$ for both symmetric-key and public-key primitives. While in 2017 Ball, Rosen, Sabin, and Vasudevan [BRSV'17] introduced a definition for fine-grained one-way functions, and provided a fine-grained worst case to average case reduction for some problems. They hoped to use these average case hard problems to build a fine-grained one-way function, but did not construct one.
	
	Our contribution is to start building fine-grained one-way functions and key exchanges from fine-grained average-case problems, like $k$-sum and zero $k$-clique, as well as explore the implications. First, we characterize which problems with which properties can be used to build these one-way functions, and we show that relatively weak assumptions about fine-grained problems can yield these one-way functions; these assumptions are only that it takes super-linear time for an adversary to solve such a problem. We also show that there exist fine-grained versions of hardcore bits. 
	
	Second, we provide a novel construction for a fine-grained key exchange based on a fine-grained assumption. Where previous works had to assume random oracles or the existence of strong one-way functions to get a key-exchange computable in $n$ time secure against $O(n^2)$ adversaries, such as Merkle and Biham et al respectively, we make a much weaker assumption: zero $k$-clique is requires $\tilde \Omega(n^k)$ time to solve on average. This key exchange, like Merkle and Biham's constructions, will be non-interactive, and therefore will imply fine-grained public key encryption.
