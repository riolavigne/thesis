\section{Proofs for Zero k-Clique }
\label{sec:zkcAppendix}
Proofs needed for Section \ref{sec:zkcIsAllTheThings} but are distracting or lengthy are here.

\subsection{Zero $k$-clique is a Plantable Problem}

\begin{lemma}
	The distribution $D^{zkc}_{0}[R,n]$ has total variation distance $\leq n^k/R$ from the distribution of instances where every edge weight is chosen uniformly at random from $[0,R-1]$, $D_{uniform}[R,k,n]$.
	\label{lem:TVDnosol}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	$D^{zkc}_{0}[R,n]$ is uniform over all instances of size $n$ where there are no solutions. $D_{uniform}[R,k,n]$ is uniform over all instances of size $n$. 
	
	Let $D$ be the distribution of instances in $D_{uniform}[R,k,n]$ which are in the support of $D^{zkc}_{0}[R,n]$. Because both $D_{uniform}[R,k,n]$ and $D^{zkc}_{0}[R,n]$ are uniform over the support of $D^{zkc}_{0}[R,n]$, $D = D^{zkc}_{0}[R,n]$.
	
	So the total variation distance between $D^{zkc}_{0}[R,n]$ and $D_{uniform}[R,k,n]$ is just 
	$$Pr_{I \approx D_{uniform}[R,k,n]}[x \nin \text{ the support of } D^{zkc}_{0}[R,n]].$$
	
	The expected number of zero $k$-cliques is $n^k/R$, every set of $k$ nodes has a chance of $1/R$ of being a zero $k$-clique. Thus, the probability that an instance has a non-zero number of solutions is $\leq n^k/R$. So, the total variation distance is $\leq n^k/R$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	The distribution $D^{zkc}_{1}[R,n]$ has total variation distance $\leq n^k/R+n^{k-2}/R$ from the distribution of instances where every edge weight is chosen uniformly at random from $[0,R-1]$ and then a clique is planted. 
	The planting procedure is: choose $k$ nodes, $a_1,\ldots, a_k$, uniformly at random from each partition with one node from each partition, choose a uniformly random choice of pair $a_i,a_j$ $i\ne j$, set the weight of the edge $(a_i,a_j)$ to the weight such that $a_1,\ldots, a_k$ is a zero-k-clique. Call this planted distribution $D_{plant}$.
	\label{lem:TVDonesol}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We want to first show that $D_{plant}$ is uniform over the support of $D^{zkc}_{1}[R,n]$. Consider an instance $I$ in the support of $D^{zkc}_{0}[R,n]$. Let $S(I) = a_1, \ldots , a_k$ be the set of $k$ nodes  in which there is a zero $k$-clique. $Pr_{I' \approx D_{plant}}[I' = I]$ is given by the chance that
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the nodes chosen in $I'$ ($a_1',\ldots, a_k'$) to plant a clique are the same as those in $S(I)$,
		\item the edges in the clique have the same weights in $I'$ and $I$ and,
		\item all edges outside the clique have the same weight in $I'$ and $I$. 
	\end{itemize}
	$$Pr_{I' \approx D_{plant}}[I' = I] = \left(n^{-k} \right)  \left(R^{-\binom{k}{2}-1} \right)  \left(R^{-\binom{k}{2}(n^2-1)} \right) .$$
	
	This is the same probability for all instances $I$ in the support of $D^{zkc}_{1}[R,n]$. 
	
	So, we need only bound the probability 
	$$Pr_{I \approx D_{plant}}[x \nin \text{ the support of } D^{zkc}_{1}[R,n]].$$
	
	By Lemma \ref{lem:TVDnosol} the initial process of choosing edges the probability of producing a clique is $\leq n^k/R$. We then change one edge's weight, this intrudces a clique. It introduces an expected number of additional cliques $\leq n^{k-2}/R$ (this is the number of cliques it participates in). Thus, we can bound the probability of more than one clique by $\leq n^k/R+n^{k-2}/R$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Zero $k$-clique is Splittable}
Now we prove that ranges other than powers of $4$ work. 

\begin{theorem}
	Zero-k-clique is generalized splittable with error $\leq \binom{k}{2}4^{\binom{k}{2}}3 n^k/\sqrt{R}$. 
	\label{thm:zkcsplittable}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Given an instance $I$ with range $R$ we will produce $\leq \binom{k}{2}4^{\binom{k}{2}}$ instances, corresponding to guesses over what ranges the clique edge weights fall into. 
	
	Take the next smallest power $R' = \sup\{2^{2x}| 2^{2x}<R \text{ and } x\in \mathbb{Z} \} $. 
	Now let $c = \lceil R/R' \rceil$. We will now create $c$ subsets of $R$ each of size $R'$.  $S_i = [R'i,R'(i+1)-1]$ for $i\in [0,c-2]$ and $S_{c-1} = [R-R' , R-1]$. Note that these subsets completely cover the range $[0, R-1]$ and are each of size $R'$. Let $\Delta_i = R'i$ for $i\in [0,c-2]$ and $\Delta_{c-1} = R-R'$. 
	
	Let the partitions of $I$ be $P_1, \ldots, P_k$. Let the set of edges between $P_i$ and $P_j$ be $E_{i,j}$. For all $i,j$ pairs $i\ne j$ we will choose a number between $[0,c-1]$. Call these numbers $g_{i,j}$ and the full list of them $\vec{g}$. For all possible choices of $\vec{g} \in \mathbb{Z}_{c}^{\binom{k}{2}}$ and $d \in [0, \binom{k}{2}-1]$ we will generate an instance $I_{\vec{g},d}$ over range $R'$ as follows: 
	
	For edge set $E_{i,j}$ that isn't $E_{1,2}$, for every edge in that edge set $e \in E_{i,j}$ if the weight of $e$, $w(e) \in S_{g_{i,j}}$ then set $w_{\vec{g},d}(e) = w(e) \mod R'$, if $w(e) \nin S_{g_{i,j}}$ then set $w_{\vec{g},d}$ to be a weight chosen uniformly at random from $[0, R'-1]$. Now note that these values are completely uniform over the range from $[0,R'-1]$. 
	
	For $E_{1,2}$ , for every edge in that edge set $e \in E_{1,2}$ if the weight of $e$, $w(e) \in S_{g_{1,2}}$ then set $w_{\vec{g},d}(e) = w(e) + dR \mod R'$, if $w(e) \nin S_{g_{1,2}}$ then set $w_{\vec{g}}$ to be a weight chosen uniformly at random from $[0, R'-1]$. Now note that these values are also completely uniform over the range from $[0,R'-1]$. 
	
	If no clique existed in the original instance then the chance that one is produced here is bounded by $n^k/R' \leq n^k4/R'$ by Lemma \ref{lem:TVDnosol}. Because we make so many queries this chance that any of them induce a clique is $\leq \binom{k}{2}4^{\binom{k}{2}}n^k4/R'$. 
	
	If the original instance was drawn from $D^{zkc}_{1}[R,n]$ then by Lemma\ref{lem:TVDonesol} this is only $\leq n^k/R + n^{k-2}/R$ total variation distance away from the instance generated by choosing each edge at random and then planting a clique. Then the procedure produces uniformly looking edges except for the planted edge. In the generated instance where the original zero clique edge weights are in $\vec{g}$ and the zero k-clique sums to $dR$ then the instance $I_{\vec{g},d}$ will have that planted edge set to the value such that zero k-clique from the original is a planted instance. So, that produced instance is drawn from a distribution with total variation distance $\leq n^k/R' + n^{k-2}/{R'}$ from $D^{zkc}_{1}[R',n]$. 
	
	Then we use the splitting procedure from Lemma \ref{lem:zkcSplitConvenientRange} to generate two instances from each of our generated instances. The probability of a no instance becoming a yes instance is $\leq \binom{k}{2}4^{\binom{k}{2}}3 n^k/\sqrt{R}$, if there is a yes instance then it will generate a yes instance and have total variation distance at most $\leq \binom{k}{2}4^{\binom{k}{2}}3 n^k/\sqrt{R}$ from $D^{zkc}_{1}[\sqrt{R'},n]^2$.
\end{proof}
