\section{Larger Ranges are Still Hard}


\begin{theorem}
	\Strongzkc for range $R(n)=n^{c k}$ is implied by the Random Edge \RandomZKC if $c>1$ is a constant.
	\label{thm:rangeExtendThm}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Create $n^{(1-1/c)}$ random partitions of the nodes where each partition is of size $n^{1/c}$. Then generate $n^{(1-1/c)k}$ graphs by choosing every possible choice of $k$ partitions.
	
	This results in $n^{(1-1/c)k}$ problems of size  $n^{1/c}$ with range $n^k$. 
	
	If an algorithm $A$ violated \Strongzkc for range $n^{c k}$ then it must have some running time of the form $O(n^{k-\delta})$. We could run $A$ on all $n^{(1-1/c)k}$ problems, resulting in a running time of $n^{k/c-\delta/c}n^{(1-1/c)}k = O(n^{k-\delta/c})$ for the Random Edge problem. If we find a valid zero-$k$-clique then we return $1$. If we don't we return $0$ with probability $1/2$ and $1$ with probability $1/2$.
	
	Let $p_1$ be the probability that any one of the $n^{k/c}$ has exactly one clique, conditioned on $sol(I)=1$. 
	
	If \Strongzkc is violated then we return the correct answer with the probability at least $p_1 \frac{1}{100} + (1-p_1/100)/2 = 1/2+p_1\frac{1}{200}$. So, we now want to lower bound the value of $p_1$. 
	
	%Let $p_0'$ ,$p_1'$ and $p_{\geq 2}'$ be the probabilities that a single instance of size $n^{k/c}$ has zero, one or at least two cliques respectively.
	
	The probability that there are more than $2$ cliques in a subproblem of size  $n^{1/c}$, conditioned on there being at least one clique is at most $n^{-k(1-1/c)}$. Because to generate the distribution of problems of size $n^{1/c}$ with at least one clique one can plant a clique (randomly choose $k$ nodes and randomly choose $\binom{k}{2}-1$ edge weights, then choose the final edge weight such that this is a zero $k$-clique). The expected number of cliques other than the planted clique is $\frac{n^{1/c}-1}{n^k}$ and the number of cliques other than the planted clique is a non-negative integer.
	
	So conditioned $sol(I)=1$ we have that $p_1\geq 1-n^{-k(1-1/c)}$. So the probability of success, conditioned on $sol(I)=1$  is at least $p_1/100 \geq 1/200$.
	
	%So 
	%$$(p_1'+p_{\geq 2}')n^{-k(1-1/c)}\geq p_{\geq 2}'.$$ 
	%Which means 
	%$$2p_1' n^{-k(1-1/c)} \geq p_1' \frac{n^{-k(1-1/c)}}{1-n^{-k(1-1/c)}} \geq p_{\geq 2}'.$$
	
	%We finally 
	
	%We will now determine how often we are correct. Let $p_0$, $p_1$ and $p_{\geq 2}$ be the probability that the original instance has $0$, $1$ or at least $2$ zero-$k$-cliques respectively. 
	
	%The probability that there are more than $2$ cliques in a subproblem of size  $n^{1/c}$, conditioned on there being at least one clique is $\leq n^{-k(1-1/c)}$. To generate the distribution of problems of size $n^{1/c}$ with at least one clique one can plant a clique (randomly choose $k$ nodes and randomly choose $\binom{k}{2}-1$ edge weights, then choose the final edge weight such that this is a zero $k$-clique). The expected number of cliques other than the planted clique is $ n^{-k(1-1/c)}$ and the number of cliques other than the planted clique is a non-negative integer. 
	
	%We have that $p_0+p_1+p_{\geq 2}=1$ and $p_1\geq p_{\geq 2} n^{-k(1-1/c)}$. So $p_0+p_1\geq 1-n^{-k(1-1/c)}$.
	
	
	%We add error $n^{-k(1-1/c)}$, however, this is $o(\frac{1}{\lg(n)})$.
