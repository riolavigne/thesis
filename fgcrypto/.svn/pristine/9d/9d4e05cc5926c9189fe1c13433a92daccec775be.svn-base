\section{Average Case Assumptions and their Justifications}


\begin{definition}
	Average case 0 triangle instances over range $R$ are instances with $3n$ nodes in a tripartite graph with partitions $A$, $B$ and $C$. There are edges between all pairs of nodes $a\in A$ and $v \in B \cup C$ there are edges between all nodes $b\in B$ and $c\in C$. The weights on the $\Theta(n^2)$ edges are chosen uniformly at random from the range $[-R,R]$. 
	
	The distribution $D_i^R$ is the uniform distribution over 0 triangle instances where there are exactly $i$ $0$ triangles in the graph. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[The average case 0 triangle conjecture]
	There exists some large enough $c$ such that for all $c'>c$ distinguishing between instances drawn from $D_0^{n^{c'}}$  and those drawn from $D_1^{n^{c'}}$ with probability greater than $2/3$ takes $n^{3-o(1)}$ time. 
	
	Let $S(x)$ be the number of solutions in an instance $x$. Let the distribution $D$ be drawn from $D_0^{n^{c'}}$ with $1/2$ probability and drawn from $D_1^{n^{c'}}$ with $1/2$ probability. If an algorithm $A$ takes $n^{3-\epsilon}$ time for some $\epsilon>0$ then
	$$P_{x\in D}[A(x) = S(x)] < 2/3$$
