\section{Properties of $k$-SUM and Zero $k$-clique Hypotheses}
\label{sec:kcliqueksumAllTHeThings}
In this section, we will prove the properties that $k$-SUM and Zero $k$-Clique have that will make them useful in constructing fine-grained OWFs and our fine-grained key exchange.

\subsection{$k$-SUM and Zero $k$-Clique are Plantable from Weak Hypotheses}
Here we will show that by assuming the Weak $k$-SUM hypothesis (see definition \ref{def:weak-k-sum}), we get that $k$-SUM is plantable and $n^{2+\delta}$-\ACIH. The proof is relatively straightforward: just show that planting a solution in a random $k$-SUM-$R$ instance is easy while making sure that the distributions are close to what you expect. The full proof of this is in appendix \ref{sec:zkcAppendix}

\begin{theorem}
	Assuming the weak $k$-SUM-$R$ hypothesis, $k$-SUM-$R$ is plantable with error $\leq 2n^k/R$ in $O(n)$ time.
	%If the weak $k$-sum hypothesis holds over a range $R > 100 n^k$, then $k$-SUM-$R$ is $n^{2+\delta}$-\ACIH.
	\label{thm:ksumPlantable}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	First, we will define $\Generate(n,b)$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $b = 0$: choose all $kn$ entries uniformly at random from $[0,R-1]$, taking time $O(n)$.
		\item $b = 1$: choose all $kn$ entries uniformly at random from $[0,R-1]$, then choose values $v_1, \dots, v_k$, each $v_i$ at random from partition $P_i$, and choose $i \getsr [k]$. Set $v_i = - \sum_{j \neq i} v_j \mod R$. This takes time $O(n)$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	We need to show that $\Generate(n,0)$ is $\epsilon$-close to $D_0$ and $\Generate(n,1)$ is $\epsilon$-close to $D_1$.
	
	First, we note that $\Generate(n,0)$ has the following property: $\Pr_{I \sim \Generate(n,0)}[I = I' | val(I) = 0 ] = \Pr_{I \sim D_0}[I = I']$. This is because $\Generate(n,0)$ samples uniformly over the support of $D_0$. So, the total variation distance between $\Generate(n,0)$ and $D_0$ is the probability $\Generate(n,0)$ samples outside of the support of $D_0$, that is, the probability $\Generate(n,0)$ samples an $I$ with a value $1$ or greater. Now, a union bound gives us
	\[ TVD(\Generate(n,0), D_0) = \Pr_{I \sim \Generate(n,0)}[val(I) \ge 1] \le \sum_{\mbox{all $n^k$ sums $\vec s \in [n]^k$}} \Pr_{I \sim \Generate(n,0)}[\mbox{$\vec s$ is a $k$-sum}] = \frac{n^k}{R}. \]
	
	Now, to show that $\Generate(n,1)$ is $\epsilon$-close to $D_1$, we will use the fact that total-variation distance ($TVD$) is a metric and the triangle inequality. Let $\Generate(n,0) +$ Plant and $D_0 + $ Plant denote sampling from the first distribution and planting a $k$-sum solution at random (so $\Generate(n,0) +$ Plant $= \Generate(n,1)$. We have that \[TVD(\Generate(n,1), D_1) \le TVD(\Generate(n,0) + \mbox{Plant}, D_0 + \mbox{Plant}) + TVD(D_0 + \mbox{Plant}, D_1).\]
	The distance $\Generate(n,0) +$ Plant from $D_0 + $ Plant is equal to the distance from $\Generate(n,0)$ and $D_0$, since the planting does equivalent things. As previously shown, this distance is at most $\frac{n^k}{R}$. The distance from $D_0 +$ Plant and $D_1$ is just the chance that we introduce more than one clique by planting. We are only changing one value in the $D_0$ instance, $v_i$. There are $n^{k-1} - 1 \le n^{k-1}$ possible sums involving $v_i$, so the chance that we accidentally introduce an unintended $k$-sum solution is at most $\frac{n^{k-1}}{R}$. Therefore,
	\[TVD(\Generate(n,1), D_1) \le \frac{n^k}{R} + \frac{n^{k-1}}{R} < \frac{2n^k}{R}\] \qed
\end{proof}

Note that when $R > 6n^k$  $\Generate(n,1)$ has total variation distance $< 1/3$ from $D_1(k-$SUM$-R,n)$.


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:zkcPlantable}
	Assuming the weak Zero $k$-Clique hypothesis over range $R$, Zero $k$-Clique is plantable with error $\leq 2n^k/R$ in $O(n^2)$ time.
\end{theorem}

The proof of this mirrors of the proof that $k$-SUM-$R$ is plantable and is detailed in appendix \ref{sec:zkcAppendix}. Note that the size of a $k$-Clique instance is $O(n^2)$, and so the fact that this requires $O(n^2)$ time is just that it is linear in the input size. Here we will just list what the $\Generate$ functionality is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Generate(n,0)$ outputs a complete $k$-partite graph with $n$ nodes in each partition, and edge weights drawn uniformly from $\Z_R$. This takes $O(n^2)$ time.
	\item $\Generate(n,1)$ starts with $\Generate(n,0)$, and then plants a clique by choosing a node from each partition, $v_1 \in P_1, \dots, v_k \in P_k$, choosing an $i \neq j \getsr [k]$, and setting the weight $w(v_i, v_j) = -\sum_{(i', j') \neq (i,j)} w(v_{i'}, v_{j'}) \mod R$. This also takes $O(n^2)$ time.
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately for general $k$-SUM, the problem does not lend itself well to being average-case list-hard or splittable, as far as we can see. However, we will show that if we assume that Zero $k$-Clique is \emph{search} hard (strictly weaker assumption than being indistinguishably hard), we can get plantable, list-hard, and splittable properties --- the caveat is that we must assume that Zero $k$-Clique requires $\~\Omega(n^k)$ time to solve (not just super-linear in the input size).


\subsection{Zero k-Clique is Plantable, Average Case List-Hard and, Splittable from Strong Hypothesis}
\label{sec:zkcIsAllTheThings}

Recall that the strong hypothesis is actually a search problem, and unfortunately, there is no average-case to average-case reduction from search to decision for Zero $k$-Clique that we are aware of. The existing worst-case reductions break down because of the need for recursion and the error we allow our adversary\footnote{The recurrence really throws us for a loop, so to speak.}.

Now we will prove that Zero $k$-Clique has the properties we need for our key exchange. 

\subsubsection{Zero $k$-Clique is a Plantable Problem}

The proof of this theorem follows from the proof for theorem \ref{thm:zkcPlantable}, even though it was for the decision version of Plantability.
\begin{theorem}
	Zero $k$-Clique is plantable in time $O(n^2)$ with error $\leq 2n^k/R$ under that Strong Zero-$k$-Clique Hypothesis.
	\label{thm:zkcSearchPlantable}
\end{theorem}
The idea is that $\Generate(n)$ is the same as $\Generate(n,1)$ for the decision version. We proved that $\Generate(n,1)$ has TVD from $D_1$ at most $2n^k/R$, which finishes the proof.


\subsubsection{Zero $k$-clique is Average Case List-Hard}

%Also true for the decision version! If we want the decision version instead 
% We can include the commented out points about D_0
We present the proof that zero $k$-clique is average case list-hard in Section \ref{sec:appendixListHard} in Theorem \ref{thm:zkcSelfReduce}.  We will state the the theorem here as well.

\begin{theorem}
	Given the \strongzkc, Zero $k$-Clique is Average Case List-Hard with list length $\ell(n)$ for any $\ell(n) = n^{\Omega(1)}$.
	\label{thm:zkcAvgListHard}
\end{theorem}

The intuition of the proof is as follows. There is an efficient worst case self-reduction for the zero-k-clique problem. This self-reduction results in $\ell'(n)^k$ subproblems of size $n/\ell'(n)$. One can choose $\ell'(n)$ of these instances such that they are generated from non-overlapping parts of the original instance. They will then look uniformly randomly generated. 

Now we will have generated many, $\ell^{'k}(n)$ of these list versions of the $k$-clique problem, where only one of them has the unique solution. We show that the problem is Average Case List-Hard by demonstrating that we can make many independent calls to the algorithm despite correlations between the instances called. Specifically, we only care about the response on one of these instances, so as long as that instance is random then we can solve the original problem. 


\subsubsection{Zero $k$-Clique is Splittable}
Next we show that zero-k-clique is splittable. 

Intuitively we will split the weights in half bit-wise, taking the first half of the bits of each edge weight, and then we take the second half of the bits of each edge weight to make another instance. If the $\binom{k}{2}$ weights on a $k$ clique sum to zero then the first half of all the weights sum to zero, up to carries, and the second half of all the weights sum to zero, also up to carries. We simply guess the carries. We start by proving this for a convenient range and then show we can use a reduction to get more arbitrary ranges.

\begin{lemma}
	Zero-$k$-Clique is generalized splittable with error $\leq 4(\binom{k}{2} + 1) n^k/\sqrt{R}$ when $R=4^{x}$ for some integer $x$. 
	\label{lem:zkcSplitConvenientRange}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We are given an instance of Zero-$k$-Clique $I$ with $k$ partitions, $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ of $n$ nodes and with edge weights generated uniformly at random from $[0,R-1]$, where $R = 2^{2x}$ for some positive integer $x$.

	First we will define some helpful notation to describe our procedure.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Let $\ZkC[R]$ denote the Zero-$k$-Clique problem over range $R$.
		\item Let $w(P_i[a],P_j[b])$ be the weight of the edge in instance $I$ between the $a^{th}$ node in  $P_i$ and the $b^{th}$ node in $P_j$.
		\item Let $u$ be some number in the range $[0,R-1]$. Let $\high{u}$ be the high order $\lg(R)/2$ bits of the number $u$ (this will be an integer because $R$ is a power of 4). Let $\low {u}$ be the low order $\lg(R)/2$ bits of the number $u$.\\
		For the sake of notation, $\high w (P_i[a], P_j[b])$ denotes $\high{[w (P_i[a], P_j[b])]}$, and same for $\low w (P_i[a], P_j[b])$ denoting $\low {[w (P_i[a], P_j[b])]}$.
	\end{itemize}

	\newcommand{\lowI}{I_{low}}
	\newcommand{\highI}{I_{high}}
	Here is the reduction to take one instance of $\ZkC[R]$ and create a list of pairs of instances of $\ZkC[\sqrt R]$.
	%TODO: need to put this in an algorithm
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Take the $\ZkC[R]$ instance $I$ and create two instances of $\ZkC[\sqrt R]$, $\lowI$ and $\highI$ by the following:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item For every edge $(P_i[a], P_j[b])$ in $I$, let the corresponding edge in $\lowI$ have weight $\low w(P_i[a], P_j[b])$ and the edge in $\highI$ have weight $\high w(P_i[a], P_j[b])$.
		\end{itemize}
		\item For every $c \in [0,\binom k 2]$:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Let $I_1^{c}$ be a copy of $\lowI$, but randomly permute all nodes.
			\item Let $I_2^{c}$ be a copy of $\highI$, but choose a random pair of a partitions $P_j$ and $P_j$: for all edges $e_2 \in I_2^{c}$ between $P_i$ and $P_j$, a copy of edge $e \in \highI$, , let $w(e_2) = w(e) + c \mod \sqrt R$.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Output the list $[(I_1^{(0)}, I_2^{(0)}), \ldots, (I_1^{(\binom k 2)}, I_2^{(\binom k 2)})]$
	\end{enumerate}
	For a visual aid, see figure \ref{fig:splittableRed} for a depiction of the splittable triangles.

		\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{SplittableFig.pdf}
		\caption{An example of splitting the edges of triangles whose edges sum to $16$.}
		\label{fig:splittableRed}
	\end{figure}

	We will now show that we get the desired distributions in our list of instances depending on whether $I \sim D_0(\ZkC[R], n)$ or $I \sim D_1(\ZkC[R], n)$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $I \sim D_0(\ZkC[R], n)$. We need to show that every pair $(I_1^{(c)}, I_2^{(c)})$ is sampled from a distribution total variation distance $\le 2n^k/\sqrt R$ from $D_0(\ZkC[\sqrt R], n)^2$. Note that every pair is correlated very heavily with every other pair with respect to edge weights. But, within each pair, they are close to $D_0(\ZkC[\sqrt R], n)^2$.
		
		From lemma \ref{lem:TVDnosol}, this is TVD at most $\frac {n^k}{R}$ from just choosing edge-weights uniformly at random. So, consider $I' \sim \Generate(n,0)$, and do the same operations as for $I$ in the reduction: every bit in every edge weight will be chosen uniformly at random, meaning that the edge-weights in $\lowI'$ and $\highI'$ will also be uniform over $\sqrt R$. Permuting the nodes in $\lowI'$ does not change this distribution, and neither does adding (any) $c$ to a subset of edges in $\highI'$. Therefore, using lemma \ref{lem:TVDnosol}, \emph{both} $I_1'^{(c)}$ and $I_2'^{(c)}$ are TVD at most $\frac{n^k}{\sqrt R}$ from $D_0(\ZkC[\sqrt R], n)$. Since TVD is a metric, this implies that $I_1^{(c)}$ is TVD at most $n^k / \sqrt R$ from the distribution of $I_1'^{(c)}$, and thus at most $n^k / \sqrt R + n^k/ R$ from $D_0(\ZkC[\sqrt R], n)$ --- the same is true for $I_2^{(c)}$, even when conditioned on $I_1^{(c)}$. Therefore, the pair, for every $c$, is TVD at most $2(n^k / \sqrt R + n^k/ R) \le \frac{4 n^k}{\sqrt R}$.
		
		
		\item $I \sim D_1(\ZkC[R], n)$. We want to show that we get a list in which exactly one of the pairs of instances is distributed close to $D_1(\ZkC[\sqrt R], n)^2$.
		
		We will take a similar approach here, considering the planted distribution of $I$ instead of the true one. Let $I' \sim \Generate(n,1)$, so by lemma \ref{lem:TVDonesol}, $I'$ is TVD at most $2n^k/R$ from $D_1$. We will first show that $\lowI'$ is also drawn from a planted distribution over the range $\sqrt R$.
		Let $e'$ be the edge's weight that was changed to plant a zero clique. Now, for every edge except $e'_{low}$, the edges of $\lowI'$ are distributed uniformly. $e'$ is a randomly chosen edge corresponding to a randomly chosen clique in $I'$, and therefore $e'_{low}$ is also a randomly chosen edge corresponding to a randomly chosen clique in $\lowI'$. The act of making that clique sum to 0 mod $R$ also requires that the low-order bits sum to $0$ mod $\sqrt R$ --- otherwise the high-order bits cannot cancel out anything left over. Therefore, by setting $w(e')$ to the value making the clique sum to 0, we are exactly planting a clique in $\lowI'$. This distribution has TVD $\le \frac{2n^k}{\sqrt R}$ from $D_1(\ZkC[\sqrt R], n)$. Because $I_1'^{(c)}$ is just a permutation on the nodes of $\lowI'$ for every $c$, $I_1'^{(c)}$ will have TVD at most $\frac{2n^k}{\sqrt R}$ from $D_1$ as well.
		
		Now, we need that at least one of the pairs in this list to be close to $D_1(\ZkC[\sqrt R], n)^2$. It will turn out that there exists a $c$ such that $I_2'^{(c)}$ will also be close to $D_1$ (whereas $I_1'^{(c)}$ is distributed close to $D_1$ for every $c$). Let $c^*$ be the correct carry --- that is for the clique planted in $I'$, $\sum_{e \in clique} \low w(e) = \sqrt R c^* \mod R$. Now, without loss of generality, we can assume that in the plant of $I'$, the edge $e^*$ chosen to complete the zero-$k$ clique was between partitions $P_i$ and $P_j$. So, considering every other edge in $I_2'^{(c^*)}$, it is distributed uniformly at random (adding $c^*$ will not change that distribution). Now, for that special clique $C^*$ that was planted in $I'$, we have that
		\begin{align*}
		\sum_{e \in C^*} w(e) &= \sqrt R \cdot \sum_{e \in C^*} \high w(e) + \sum_{e \in C^*} \low w(e)\\
		&= \sqrt R (\sum_{e \in C^*} \high w(e) + c^*)\\
		&= \sqrt R (\high w(e^*) + c^* + \sum_{e \in C^*, e \neq e^*} \high w(e)) = 0 \mod R
		\end{align*}
		Since the quantity $\sqrt R (\high w(e^*) + c^* + \sum_{e \in C^*, e \neq e^*} \high w(e))$ is 0 mod $R$, then $\high w(e^*) + c^* + \sum_{e \in C^*, e \neq e^*} \high w(e) = 0 \mod \sqrt R$.
		
		This means that $I_2'^{(c^*)}$ is drawn from $\Generate(n,1)$ over the range $\sqrt R$. Since TVD is a metric, we have that for $I \sim D_1(\ZkC[\sqrt R], n)$ (TVD at most $\frac {n^k}{R}$ from $\Generate(n, 1)$), there exists a $c^*$ such that $I_2^{(c^*)}$ is TVD at most $\frac{2n^k}{\sqrt R}$ from $D_1$ --- even when dependent on $I_1^{(c^*)}$. Therefore, the TVD of $(I_1^{(c^*)}, I_2^{(c^*)}) = \Split(I)$ to $D_1^2$ is at most $\frac{4 n^k}{\sqrt R}$.
	\end{itemize}
	Therefore, when $I \sim D_0(\ZkC[R], n)$, we get a list of pairs of instances TVD $\le 4n^k / \sqrt R$ from $D_0(\ZkC[R], n)^2$; the probability that any of these pairs here err is $\le(\binom k 2 + 1) \cdot \frac{4n^k}{\sqrt R}$ by a union bound. Similarly, when $I \sim D_1(\ZkC[R], n)$, we get there exists a pair in this list of the form $D_1(\ZkC[R], n)^2$; the probability of erring here is $\le \frac{4 n^k }{\sqrt R}.$
	
	Therefore, the total error here is $\le (\binom k 2 + 1) \cdot \frac{4n^k}{\sqrt R}$.
	\qed
\end{proof}

Our techniques generalize to any large enough range, though the proof of that is much more involved and pushed to appendix \ref{sec:zkcsplittable}.

\begin{theorem}
	Zero-k-clique is generalized splittable over any range $R$, with error $\leq \binom{k}{2}4^{\binom{k}{2}}3 n^k/\sqrt{R}$. 
	\label{thm:zkcsplittable}
\end{theorem}
%TODO: go through that proof, too. is this statement correct?
