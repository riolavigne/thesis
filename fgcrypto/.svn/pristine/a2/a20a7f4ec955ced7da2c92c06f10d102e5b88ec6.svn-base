\section{Fine Grained One Way Functions}

\begin{lemma}
Given an average case instance of k-clique with values drawn from a sufficiently large range $R$ we can efficiently generate an average case instance by planting a solution. 

That is, there exists a procedure $P$ which runs in time $O(n^{k-2}+k^2)$ time which generates an instance with one solution uniformly from all instances with one solution, given that we were given an instance with no solutions uniformly at random. 
	\label{lem:kcliquePlant}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	\xxx{TODO: but you know, its not so hard to prove this}
\end{proof}

Given $I,(a,b,c)$ and, $(w_{a,b}, w_{b,c})$ let $I'$ be an instance of $I$ with three edge weights changed. Specifically, set $w(e_{a,b})= w_{a,b}$, $w(e_{b,c})= w_{b,c}$ and, $w(e_{c,a})= -w_{a,b}-w_{b,c}$.

\begin{definition}
Let $I$ be an instance of $0$ k-clique
Let $f_{kClique}$ be the function 
$$f_{kClique}(I,(a,b,c),(w_{a,b}, w_{b,c})) =
\begin{cases}
\emptyset , & \text{if }e(a,b), e(b,c),\text{or } e(c,a) \text{ are involved in a }0 \text{-triangle in I} \\
\emptyset , & \text{if }e(a,b), e(b,c),\text{or } e(c,a) \text{ are involved in }> \text{1  }0 \text{-triangles in I'} \\
I', & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$
\end{definition}

\xxx{TODO: can we get away with not checking for the null characters? It will still be hard over the distribution when the inputs are average case 0 solutions. Then computing $f$ will be $O(n^2)$ this doesn't matter unless $k>4$.}

\begin{theorem}
The function $f_{kClique}$ is a fine-grained one way function over the distribution of inputs drawn uniformly from $k$-Clique instances with $0$ solutions given the average case $0$-k Clique assumption. 
\label{thm:kcliqueOWF}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Computing $f_{kClique}$ takes $n^{k-2}$ time when the instance $I$ has $n$ nodes. 

Let $D_I$ be the uniform distribution over $0$-k clique instances with $0$ solutions. \\
Let $D_{a,b,c)}$ be the uniform distribution of triples with each value chosen uniformly from $[1,n]$.\\
Let $D_{w}$ be the distribution from Lemma \ref{lem:kcliquePlant} that generates average case solutions. \\
Let $D_{in}$ be the distribution made by sampling $I$ from $D_I$, $(a,b,c)$ from $D_{(a,b,c)}$ and $(w_{a,b},\ldots)$ from $D_{w}$.

Let the Adversary have a $\epsilon$ probability of inverting the function when the input to the function is chosen from $D_{in}$.

We will then use the adversary to distinguish a random $0$ solution instance from a $1$ solution instance. If we are given an instance $\hat{I}$ then we give the adversary this instance and ask for an inversion. 

If the instance has $0$ solutions the adversary will be unable to invert (no $(a,b,c)$ triple will form a $0$-triangle). If the instance has $1$ solution, this is by Lemma \ref{lem:kcliquePlant} going to be the same distribution as applying the function to the distribution from $D_{in}$. 

Thus, the Adversary will invert the function and find the $0$-k clique an $\epsilon$ fraction of the time. If the Adversary fails we will guess $0$ solutions, if the Adversary succedes we will guess $1$ solution. 

Given that  $\hat{I}$ has a $1/2$ chance of being a $0$ input then we guess correctly $1/2+\epsilon$ of the time. 

Thus, the Adversary can not invert the function correctly with probability $\geq 1/3$.
